# MTGA_Rank_MC

Monte Carlo model of MTGArena ranked system.

# Info
Considerations that have been made because I didn't see any public statements on that:
* Protection only last for the first game played after going up a tier
* After you go down a tier, you are left only one game away of going back to that tier

Please if you see anything wrong let me know here or in Twitter(@jge_ryu)
